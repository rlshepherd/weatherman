# {{ Weatherman }}
Automated weather station for your neighborhood. 

## About

Weatherman is your home or neighborhood weather station. This repository
contains the software and instructions. You'll need to bring your own hardware.

This project was created because my neighborhood doesn't have a proper weather 
station. I wanted to track weather and air quality conditions, and realized
other people probably did too. So I designed the project to work on Twitter. It
could be integrated with any web or messaging service for broadcast. 

## Getting started

You'll need the following hardware:
1. 1x Arduino
2. 1x Raspberry Pi
3. 1x DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
4. Basic electrical components (tools, breadboards, wires, etc.)
4. Either access to a  computer or some peripherals for the Pi
5. A Twitter account with dev credentials
