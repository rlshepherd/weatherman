2. Twitter integration
3. Live air pollution alerts
4. Data history
5. Convenient methods for calculating weather metrics like Dew Point
6. A web dashboard for visualizing historical data

## My Weatherman
Weatherman was inspired by the Taiwan weather station application, which lets you monitor weather conditions, including air pollution in real time. Unfortunately, our neighborhood didn't have a weather station. So we decided to create weatherman to give us and our neighbors real time updates on weather and air quality conditions. 

You can follow my weatherman's reports on Twitter:
