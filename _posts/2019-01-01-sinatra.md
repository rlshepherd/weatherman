We now have a running historical weather record stored on a raspberry-pi. Interesting but not going anywhere. Now, we will unlease the data's potential by adding an API layer. 

## Language and Framework

For this entry, we mix things up a bit by departing from python and venutring into [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/). 

Ruby was a new choice for me, and required some studying. The official quick intro [Ruby in 20 minutes]](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/) is a great place to start. 

Sinatra is a very thin framework, similar in structure to Flask for python. Getting up and running is very simple: 

```ruby
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  "hello from #{`uname -a`}"
end
```

## Active Record

Sinatra will need an interface and driver to get data from the SQLite weather database. [Active Record]() the standard ORM for Ruby on Rails. It is based on the Active Record model [described by Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html), very mature, and well documented. There is also a port for Sinatra, [sinatra-activerecord](https://github.com/janko-m/sinatra-activerecord).

In this case, we are just interested in taking Sinatra for a spin as a read-only API. While violating the core principal of the Active Record model, we get a very simple server:

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'sinatra'
require 'sinatra/activerecord'
require 'sqlite3'
require 'json'

ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
  :adapter => "sqlite3",
  :database => "../raspberry-pi/weather.db"
)

class Weather < ActiveRecord::Base
  self.table_name = "weather"
end

get '/weather/latest' do
  @weather = Weather.last
  content_type :json
  {data: @weather}.to_json
end

get "/weather/range" do
  @weather = Weather.where("datetime >= :start_date AND datetime <= :end_date",
                          {start_date: params[:start_date], end_date: params[:end_date]})
  content_type :json
  {data: @weather}.to_json
end
```

Ruby is a very opinionated language, focused on practicality and developer produtivity. After getting used to the particulars, the language and ecosystem really does deliver on the promise of lots of functionality per line of code.

## Getting Online

Now that we have an interface, we need to handle requests from the public internet directly from the pi. Instead of configuring port forwarding on the household router, we use [Ngrok](http://www.ngrok.com). Ngrok is a tool for exposing local servers on public addresses. After a quick setup, we have a public address:

![Ngrok](/weatherman/assets/ngrok.png)

Once ngrok is up and running on the pi, we can test out our API:

![curl](/weatherman/assets/curl.png)

Success! Next up, we'll start building some applications that use the API.
