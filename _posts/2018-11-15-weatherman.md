This post is intended to introduce the goals of the weatherman project. i

Taiwan suffers frome increasingly [severe air pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution_in_Taiwan), specifically fine particles known as [PM2.5](https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/indoors/air/pmq_a.htm) which affect the respitory system. In order to avoid going outside during, my family and I have increasingly become dependant on the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau's [Taiwan Air Quality Monitoring Network](https://taqm.epa.gov.tw/taqm/en/default.aspx), which provides minutely updates from a group of weather monitoring stations located around Taiwan and outlying islands. These updates include the location's [Air Quality Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality_index), as well as its component measure such as O3 and PM2.5. As air pollution is 

In Taipei alone, there are 19 monitoring locations. However, we recently moved to neighborhood not covered by the TAQMN. In order to make up for this gap in coverage, we decided to build our own weather monitoring station. After a bit of research, we settled on arduino, raspberry-pi, and python as our primary tool. At the start of this project, we had almost no electronics experience between us (though quite a bit of software experience). 

This website is intended to chronicle the project as we hope to make our neighborhood a little safer and learn something along the way. If you want to use this project as a starting point for your own weather station, you can start with this blog post and read your way forward in time. Thanks!
