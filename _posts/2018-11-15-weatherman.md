Our home country suffers frome increasingly [severe air pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution_in_Taiwan), specifically fine particles known as [PM2.5](https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/indoors/air/pmq_a.htm) which affect the respitory system. To avoid exposing ourselves to PM2.5, my family and I have increasingly become dependant on the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau's [Taiwan Air Quality Monitoring Network](https://taqm.epa.gov.tw/taqm/en/default.aspx), which provides minutely updates from a group of weather monitoring stations located around Taiwan and outlying islands. These updates include the location's [Air Quality Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_quality_index), as well as its component measure such as O3 and PM2.5. 

In Taipei alone, there are 19 monitoring locations. However, we recently moved to neighborhood without a nearby weather station. In order to make up for this gap in TAQMN's coverage, we decided to build our own weather monitoring station. After a bit of research, we settled on arduino, raspberry-pi, and python as our primary tool. At the start of this project, we had almost no electronics experience between us (though quite a bit of software experience). 

This website is intended to chronicle the project as we hope to make our neighborhood a little safer and learn something along the way. If you want to use this project as a starting point for your own weather station, you can start with this blog post and read your way forward in time. Thanks!
