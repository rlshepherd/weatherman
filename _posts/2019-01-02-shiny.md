Our data is finally available to the world. But it's only a bunch of numbers in JSON format. Let's fix that by adding a quick dashboard to visualize our historical weather record.

## Language and Framework

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is open-source statistical and graphing computing library. As far as computer languages go, it's a cocktail of strange linguistic choices. R's strength is producing powerful stats in few lines of code. 

R has also experienced a renaissance in the past few years. Led by people like Hadley Whickam, the introduction new tools such as the [R-Studio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com) and package ecosystems such as [the tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) have brought R back to the front of data analysis.

[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and [shiny dashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/) make up web framework for quickly creating data dashboards with R. 

R has many powerful tools for manipulating and visualizing data. In this project, we will be using R's `data.frame` object (the inspiration for python's Pandas) as well as the `ggvis` library to visualize the data.

## Getting Started

I suggest using R-Studio to create a new Shiny web application. It will handle the boilerplate and provide some convenient features out of the box. 

Every Shiny app is made of two components: the ui and the server. Here we will use shiny dashboard's `dashboardPage`, `dashboardHeader`, `dashboardSidebar`, and `dashboardBody` objects to organize our UI. The other components such as `fluidRow` and `valueBox` are standard with Shiny. 

```r
ui <- dashboardPage(
  dashboardHeader(title = "花園新城的Weather Report"),
  dashboardSidebar(),
  dashboardBody(
    fluidRow(
      valueBoxOutput("temperatureBox", width = 4),
      valueBoxOutput("humidityBox", width = 4),
      infoBoxOutput("PM25Box", width = 4)
    ),
    fluidRow(
      box(
        title = "Temperature Over Last Seven Days",
        width = 12,
        ggvisOutput("plot1")
      )
    )
  )
)
```

The above UI will support three "cards" on the first row, and large chart on the second row. We then define a server to fetch and process the data from our Sinatra API:

```r

server <- function(input, output) {
  weather <- fromJSON("http://1a46f20b.ngrok.io/weather/range?start_date=2018-12-20&end_date=2019-01-02")
  
  latest <- tail(weather$data, n = 1)
  
  output$temperatureBox <- renderInfoBox({
    valueBox(
      paste0(latest$temperature, "*C"), "Temperature", icon = icon("sun", lib = "font-awesome"),
      color = "yellow"
    )
  })
  
  output$humidityBox <- renderValueBox({
    valueBox(
      paste0(latest$humidity, "%"), "Relative Humidity", icon = icon("cloud-rain", lib = "font-awesome"),
      color = "blue"
    )
  })
  
  output$PM25Box <- renderValueBox({
    valueBox(
      "15",
      "PM 2.5",
      color = "red",
      icon = icon("biohazard")
    )
  })
  
  weather$data %>% 
    mutate(
      datetime2 = as.POSIXct(strptime(datetime, format = "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%OS"))
    ) %>% 
    ggvis(~datetime2, ~temperature) %>%
    layer_points( opacity := 0.1, fill := "lightgreen") %>% 
    layer_smooths(se = TRUE, span = 0.4, stroke = "lightblue") %>% 
    set_options(width = "auto", height = "auto") %>% 
    bind_shiny("plot1")
  }
```

That is a lot of code to take it, but there are a couple of key points:
* R's assignment operator is `<-`. Weird, I know.
* Modern R frequently uses the `%>%` or pipe operator to chain commands. This is part of R's functional programming approach.
* We are using the ggvis library to make a beautiful and informative plot of our historical weather record.
* You explicitly bind the output of visualization functions in the server object to UI components.

## Getting it online

The R-Studio foundation provides [Shinyapps.io](http://www.shinyapps.io), a platform for hosting Shiny applications. After some configuration, one-click deployment is available from within the R-Studio IDE.
